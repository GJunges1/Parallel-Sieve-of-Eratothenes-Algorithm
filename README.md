# Parallel Sieve of Eratosthenes (Crivo de Erat√≥stenes)
This project was implemented as an activity for a Distributed Systems discipline (UTFPR).

It implements both the serial and the parallel (using OpenMP) versions of the Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm, which is a method for retrieving the prime numbers between 0 and N.
